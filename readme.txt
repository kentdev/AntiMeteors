AntiMeteors - My Speedhack 2005 entry

In this game, your home planet is being bombarded with meteors, which are made even more dangerous by the fact that they are made out of antimatter.  There are so many meteors, in fact, that there's no more ammunition to fire at them!  In order to destroy the meteors and save the planet, the government has decided to use the planet's low-class citizens as projectiles.  Since anything made out of antimatter will explode violently when it comes into contact with matter, using ordinary people will work just as well as missiles when it comes to fending off the incoming antimatter-based doom.
You mission is to control one of the few remaining anti-meteor gun turrets, and defend your area.  Fire your low-class weaponry to destroy the meteors.  Keep the meteors from destroying the energy generators.  If a meteor hits your turret or all 6 energy generators are destroyed, you lose.
